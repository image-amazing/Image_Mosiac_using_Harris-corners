# use calibrartion_data dir to load calibration matrix into matlab workspace
#if not use calibration toolbox of caltech included in the same git for reference and run it over the camera images for getting a calibration matrix.
#the provided calibration matrix is for IPHONE 7 PLUS back camera

#use undistort in the same toolbox to undistort the the images to be mosiac-ed.
#change harris.m for number of matching corner points to be matched.
#plot of camera wrt to image in mosiac is also plotted.
#the rendering takes time depends on user hardware specs .
